import pytest: This imports the pytest library, which is used for writing and executing tests in Python.

from selenium import webdriver: This imports the Selenium WebDriver module, which allows interaction with web pages.

from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By: This imports the By class from Selenium, which is used to specify the mechanism to locate elements within a web page.

from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait: This imports the WebDriverWait class from Selenium, which provides waits for certain conditions to be met before proceeding with the test.

from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC: This imports commonly used expected conditions from Selenium's support module, allowing us to wait for specific conditions to occur.

import chromedriver_autoinstaller: This imports a module named chromedriver_autoinstaller, which automatically installs the ChromeDriver necessary for running Selenium tests with Chrome.

chromedriver_autoinstaller.install(): This line invokes the install() function from the chromedriver_autoinstaller module to automatically install the ChromeDriver if it's not already installed on the system.

@pytest.fixture: This is a decorator provided by pytest. It defines a fixture named browser, which is a function that provides a Selenium WebDriver instance. Fixtures are used to set up preconditions for tests, such as initializing resources needed for testing.

def browser():: This defines the browser fixture function.

driver = webdriver.Chrome(): This line initializes a Chrome WebDriver instance named driver, which will be used to interact with the Chrome browser.

yield driver: This line acts as a breakpoint within the fixture. It allows the test to run up to this point, then it yields the driver object to the test. After the test completes, the teardown code will be executed, and the driver will be quit.

driver.quit(): This line quits the WebDriver instance, closing the browser window, and performing any cleanup necessary.

def test_page_title(browser):: This defines a test function named test_page_title that takes the browser fixture as an argument.

browser.get("https://www.entrata.com/"): This navigates the browser to the specified URL.

assert "Entrata" in browser.title: This line asserts that the string "Entrata" is present in the title of the web page.

The subsequent functions (test_watch_demo_button, test_form_submission, and test_links_navigation) follow a similar structure, where each function defines a test case that interacts with the web page and performs assertions to verify certain behaviors or states.

The if __name__ == "__main__": block ensures that if the script is run directly (not imported as a module), pytest will be invoked to run all tests defined within the script.

pytest.main(): This line actually runs the tests using pytest. It collects all test functions in the script (functions named starting with test_) and executes them. Any assertions made within the test functions will be checked, and the test results will be reported.
